			<h2 style="text-align: center;">"V" - SATISFIES TO AN EXTENT</h2>
			
			<p>V is the movie which was released after a huge round of promotional work. The movie released with an immense craze for its visuals shown in the trailer and teasers and the casting of Nani and Sudheer babu as the antagonist and the protagonist respectively. Letâ€™s check whether the movie reached the hype surrounded around it.</p>
			<h2>Story:</h2>
			<p>The Plot starts off with a murder done by V (Nani) of a police officer. He leaves a challenge to the most stylish and super cop of the city Aditya (Sudheer babu). The challenge is to stop him from doing the 5 murders he planned. Did Aditya stop V? What is the motive of V? Where do Nivetha Thomas and Aditi Rao Hydari fall in this setup forms the crux of the Movie.</p>

			<h2>Positives:</h2>
			<p>The Movie was made on a medium budget but the visuals are just amazing. The cinematography is done in a splendid way. Nani has undoubtedly given us a surprise by performing the Negative role with ease. His swag and the uber cool look are spot on. Sudheer babu is just too good in the movie. He does a sincere justification to the role given to him. Nivetha had a low screen time but was effective in the scenes she was shown. Aditi gets a crucial role and she does a good job. The supporting cast like Vennela Kishore, Harish and all did an ok job with their roles. The Murders shown gives the necessary thrills to the viewers. Music was good but the BGM is much better. </p>
			<h2>Negatives:</h2>
			<p>As said by the makers the movie does not have many twists which can keep the viewers hooked to the screen but even the screenplay which can be the saviour for the film looks too slow and dragged in the middle portions. The needed suspense factor was missing in the later half as the reasons behind the killings were revealed by then. The Climax was ok but the Drama needed to make the climax look interesting was missing. A star Performer like Nivetha was not completely used to the fullest of capabilities. Writing could have been better and the editing could be better. The Killings and chases could have been great if seen on big screen.</p>
			<H2>Verdict:</H2>
			<p>On a whole V is a Typical Action entertainer with a great performer like Nani playing the psychopath role and Sudheer babu playing a good cop role. The movie is a One-time watch for the Stylish Visuals Confrontation scenes between Nani and Sudheer babu. Could have been a better watch if made the screenplay better enough. </p>
			<h2>MovieMadness Rating - 3 / 5</h2>
